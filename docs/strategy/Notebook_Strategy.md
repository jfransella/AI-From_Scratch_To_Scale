# **Notebook Implementation Strategy**

## **1\. Guiding Philosophy: Notebooks as Learning & Analysis Tools**

This strategy positions Jupyter notebooks as the primary tool for the **"teaching" and "analysis"** phases of the project, not for running the primary training experiments themselves. The core idea is to separate the execution of experiments from their narrative explanation and analysis.

* **Command Line for Execution:** All training and evaluation runs are executed via the standardized train.py and evaluate.py scripts. This ensures reproducibility and consistency.  
* **Notebooks for Analysis:** Notebooks will consume the *outputs* of these command-line runs (logs, saved models, and visualization images) to build a rich, step-by-step analysis.

## **2\. The Three-Notebook Model**

For each Keystone and Side-quest model, we will implement a set of three distinct notebooks within its /notebooks/ directory. This structure mirrors the learning phases defined in your "Learning & Development Strategy."

### **Notebook 1: 01\_Theory\_and\_Intuition.ipynb**

* **Purpose:** To serve as the interactive version of the "Theoretical Deep Dive." This notebook is for building a deep, conceptual understanding of the model *before* looking at the full implementation.  
* **Contents:**  
  * **Historical Context:** The "5 Ws" (Who, What, When, Where, Why) with markdown, images, and links to the original papers.  
  * **Architectural Blueprint:** High-level diagrams and explanations of the model's structure.  
  * **Mathematical Intuition:** Use LaTeX to render key equations, but more importantly, use simple, illustrative Python/NumPy code snippets to build intuition for what the math is doing (e.g., demonstrating a single convolution on a tiny matrix). These snippets are for teaching and are separate from the main project code.

### **Notebook 2: 02\_Code\_Walkthrough.ipynb**

* **Purpose:** To provide a guided tour of your finished code, explaining the "how" and connecting it back to the theory. This notebook does **not** replicate the code from /src; it **imports and explains it**.  
* **Contents:**  
  * **Setup & Configuration:** Import modules from /src and load the configuration from config.py, explaining each parameter.  
  * **Model Architecture:** Instantiate the model from model.py, print its summary (print(model)), and walk through each layer, explaining its purpose.  
  * **A Single Step:** Demonstrate a single forward and backward pass using a single batch of data to illustrate the training mechanics without running the full loop. This is an invaluable pedagogical tool.

### **Notebook 3: 03\_Empirical\_Analysis.ipynb**

* **Purpose:** To create the data-driven narrative for the "Demonstrate & Expose" phase. This notebook analyzes the results of a completed training run.  
* **Contents:**  
  * **Loading Results:** This notebook begins by loading the artifacts generated by a train.py run: the log file from /outputs/logs/ and the saved image files from /outputs/visualizations/.  
  * **The "Success" & "Failure" Cases:** This is where you will build your analysis. You will load the saved visualizations one by one in separate cells, each accompanied by a markdown cell explaining what the plot shows and what conclusions can be drawn from it.  
  * **The Transition Narrative:** Conclude by summarizing the model's limitations as demonstrated by the analysis, creating a clear motivation for the next model in the series.

## **3\. The End-to-End Notebook Workflow**

This strategy creates a smooth and powerful workflow for learning and documentation.

1. **Run the Experiment:** From your terminal, execute a training run and generate the necessary artifacts.  
   python src/train.py \--experiment iris-hard \--visualize

2. **Open the Analysis Notebook:** Open 03\_Empirical\_Analysis.ipynb.  
3. **Analyze Step-by-Step:**  
   * In the first cell, you might load and display the contents of the run's log file.  
   * In the next cell, you load and display the saved loss\_curve.png with a markdown explanation.  
   * In a following cell, you load and display the decision\_boundary.png with its own detailed analysis.  
     This directly implements your requirement to explain each visualization individually in a narrative format.

## **4\. "Conceptual" Models**

For models designated as "Conceptual" in your project charter, only the 01\_Theory\_and\_Intuition.ipynb notebook needs to be created. This captures the essential learning without the overhead of a full implementation and analysis.
