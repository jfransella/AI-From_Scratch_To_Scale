# Setup Path Pattern - Implementation Summary

## Problem Solved

- **Issue**: Editable installations (`pip install -e ../../utils`) were failing across the project
- **Symptoms**: `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'utils'` despite packages showing as installed
- **Root Cause**: pip editable installation path resolution issues, possibly due to Windows paths with spaces

## Solution Implemented

Created standardized `setup_path.py` files in each model directory that:

1. **Auto-detect project root** by searching for characteristic files (`utils/__init__.py`, etc.)
2. **Manually add project root** to `sys.path`
3. **Verify imports work** with built-in validation function
4. **Execute automatically** when imported

## Deployment Status ✅

| Model Directory | setup_path.py | Status | Tested |
|----------------|---------------|--------|--------|
| 01_perceptron  | ✅ Working    | ✅ Done | ✅ Verified |
| 02_adaline     | ✅ Working    | ✅ Done | ✅ Verified |
| 03_mlp         | ✅ Working    | ✅ Done | ✅ Verified |

## Usage Pattern

```python
# At the top of any script in a model directory:
import setup_path  # This automatically fixes import paths

# Now shared packages work:
import utils
import engine
import data_utils
import plotting
```

## Files Created

- `docs/templates/setup_path.py` - Master template with smart path detection
- `models/01_perceptron/setup_path.py` - Already existed, now standardized
- `models/02_adaline/setup_path.py` - New, tested working
- `models/03_mlp/setup_path.py` - New, tested working

## Benefits

- ✅ **Eliminates editable installation issues**
- ✅ **Works across all models consistently**
- ✅ **Self-validating** with built-in import verification
- ✅ **Zero-configuration** - just import and it works
- ✅ **Robust path detection** - finds project root intelligently

## Next Steps

- Update documentation to reference setup_path.py pattern instead of editable installs
- Consider applying pattern to future models as they're created
- Remove dependency on editable installations in requirements.txt files (optional)
