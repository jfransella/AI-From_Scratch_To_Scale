## 📝 **Notes and Decisions**

### Import Strategy Decision

- **Decision**: Use absolute imports (`from constants import`) instead of relative imports
- **Rationale**: Simpler for educational purposes, better compatibility with test frameworks
- **Alternative Considered**: Package-based relative imports (more complex, worse for learning)

### Constants Standardization

- **Decision**: All models must implement identical constant interfaces
- **Rationale**: Enables test framework compatibility and template reuse
- **Implementation**: Add validation script to enforce interface compliance

### Testing Strategy

- **Decision**: Model-isolated testing with explicit path management
- **Rationale**: Clearer separation, easier debugging, better educational value
- **Implementation**: Update test helpers to be explicit about model paths
