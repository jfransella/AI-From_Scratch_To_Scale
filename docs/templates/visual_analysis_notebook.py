# Visual Analysis Notebook Template

"""
This template provides a standard structure for model analysis notebooks. For each required visualization, include a code cell to generate the plot and a markdown cell for interpretation. Adapt as needed for your model and experiment.

Note: The 'plotting' package must be available in your environment. Variables such as train_losses, val_losses, y_true, y_pred, model, X, y are placeholders and should be defined in your notebook context.

# ## Learning Curves
# The learning curves show the evolution of training and validation loss/accuracy over epochs. Use these to diagnose convergence, overfitting, or underfitting.

# ## Decision Boundary
# This plot visualizes how the model partitions the feature space. For 2D datasets, it provides geometric intuition about model behavior.

# 4. Additional Visualizations (CNNs, RNNs, etc.)

# Add sections for first-layer filters, feature maps, Grad-CAM, hidden state heatmaps, etc., as appropriate for your model.
