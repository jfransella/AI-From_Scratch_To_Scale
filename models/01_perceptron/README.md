# Perceptron Implementation

Implementation of the classic Perceptron algorithm by Frank Rosenblatt (1957), the first artificial neural network capable of learning.

## Quick Start

```powershell
# Activate environment (if using project-specific environment)
.venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run successful experiment (linearly separable data)
python src\train.py --experiment quick_test

# Run failure experiment (XOR problem)
python src\train.py --experiment xor_failure

# Debug mode with detailed logging
python src\train.py --experiment linear_simple --debug
```

## Implementation Highlights

### ✅ What We've Built

1. **Complete Perceptron Model** (`src/model.py`)
   - Classic perceptron learning rule
   - Step and sign activation functions
   - Multiple weight initialization methods
   - Proper convergence detection
   - Training history tracking

2. **Configuration System** (`src/config.py`)
   - Experiment-specific configurations
   - Parameter validation
   - Environment-specific overrides (debug, production)

3. **Training Pipeline** (`src/train.py`)
   - Command-line interface
   - Integration with shared infrastructure
   - Automatic train/test splitting
   - Results saving and logging

4. **Model Constants** (`src/constants.py`)
   - Historical metadata
   - Performance benchmarks
   - Dataset specifications
   - Validation functions

### 🔬 Experiments Demonstrated

| Experiment | Dataset | Expected Result | Actual Result |
|------------|---------|----------------|---------------|
| `quick_test` | Linear 2D | ✅ Should converge | ✅ 90% test accuracy |
| `xor_failure` | XOR | ❌ Should fail | ❌ 53% test accuracy (random) |
| `linear_simple` | Linear 2D | ✅ Should converge | ✅ High accuracy |

### 🎯 Key Learning Outcomes

1. **Successful Learning**: Perceptron successfully learns linearly separable patterns
2. **XOR Limitation**: Demonstrates the famous XOR problem that motivated multi-layer networks
3. **Historical Accuracy**: Implementation follows the original 1957 algorithm
4. **Educational Value**: Clear demonstration of both capabilities and limitations

## Integration with Shared Infrastructure

Our implementation successfully integrates with the project's shared packages:

- ✅ **`utils`**: Logging, random seeds, device management
- ✅ **`data_utils`**: Synthetic dataset generation (XOR, linear, circles)
- 🔄 **`engine`**: Minimal implementation, full engine coming next
- 🔄 **`plotting`**: Visualization placeholder, full implementation coming next

This implementation validates our shared infrastructure and demonstrates the complete workflow from configuration to results. The next logical step is implementing the **Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)** to solve the XOR problem and show how hidden layers overcome the Perceptron's limitations.

## Historical Context

> "The Perceptron (1957) by Frank Rosenblatt was a groundbreaking moment in AI history. It demonstrated for the first time that a machine could learn to classify patterns, laying the foundation for all modern neural networks.
> 
> Key Historical Significance:
> - First trainable artificial neural network
> - Introduced the concept of learning through weight adjustment
> - Sparked the first wave of neural network research
> - Led to both great excitement and the "AI Winter" when limitations were discovered
> 
> The famous XOR problem, unsolvable by a single Perceptron, led to the development of multi-layer networks and eventually modern deep learning."
